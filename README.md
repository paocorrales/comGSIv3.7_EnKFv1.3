# Community GSIv3.7_EnKFv1.3

This is a version of the original GSI code that can be find in the [Developmental Testbed Center webpage](https://dtcenter.org/community-code/gridpoint-statistical-interpolation-gsi). This version includes the necesary routines to also assimilate direct clear sky radiances from the ABI sensor onboard GOES-16. 


This repository includes a file `compile_gsi_yakaira` as an example to compile the code using a GNU compiler. Trying to compile the GSI code with comp
ilers from 2020 or newers may be dificult. For mor information please refer to the [official documentation](https://dtcenter.org/community-code/gridpoint-statistical-interpolation-gsi/documentation)  or the [NOAA-EMC repository](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/GSI).
